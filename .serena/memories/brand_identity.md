# Siza Brand Identity

## Origin
Named after Álvaro Siza Vieira — Portuguese architect, Pritzker Prize 1992. Known for precision, minimalism, contextual design. "Architects don't invent anything, they transform reality."

## Tectonic Cut Philosophy
Forms defined by what is removed, not added. Every element must earn its place. The dark surface is the material the design is carved from — UI is revealed from darkness.

## Positioning
- **Category**: AI-powered UI development platform
- **Audience**: Senior frontend engineers, design-system owners, full-stack devs
- **Against**: GitHub Copilot (code completion), v0 (consumer-grade), Locofy (visual-first)
- **Differentiation**: Open-source, MCP-native, multi-provider, production-quality

## Brand Voice
| Attribute | Means | Avoid |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Precise | Every word chosen, no filler | Vague claims, marketing speak |
| Confident | We know what this is | Over-explanation, apologetics |
| Technical | Respect audience intelligence | Dumbing down |
| Dry | Wit from precision, not performance | Forced humor, emoji in product copy |
| Architectural | Think in systems, not features | Feature-list thinking |

## Writing Rules
- Write for engineers. Skip "imagine a world where..."
- State the thing: "Generates production React components" not "Helps you build better"
- Short sentences carry weight. Long sentences dilute.
- Active voice always. Never "is generated by."
- Use metaphor naturally. Never "just like an architect would."

## Logo: Anvil Evolved (Mark C)
Three offset rectangles — geological strata, structural load-bearing, forge anvil.
- **Colors**: `#7C3AED` (brand) or `#FAFAFA` (light) ONLY
- **Never**: rotate, skew, gradient fill, drop shadow, distort
- Clear space: 50% of mark height on all sides

## Wordmark
"Siza" in Outfit Bold 700. Rendered in `#FAFAFA` or `#7C3AED`. Never other color/weight. Outfit used ONLY for wordmark + hero headline — nowhere else.

## Iconography
- **Library**: Lucide React exclusively
- **Stroke**: always `strokeWidth={1.5}` — never default 2
- Icons inherit text color
- Feature icons: 20x20, `text-brand`, `bg-brand/10 rounded-lg p-2`

## Color Rule
80% dark neutrals, 20% brand purple. Color is signal, not decoration.

## Anti-Patterns
- No gradients on text — ever
- No light mode — dark only
- No emoji in product copy
- No Outfit outside hero + wordmark
- No `shadow-glow-brand` on >2 elements per page
- Never combine `shadow-glow-brand` and `shadow-card-hover` on same element
- Max 2 font weights per component (usually 600 + 400)
