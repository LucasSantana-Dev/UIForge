## Overview

Every component and page generated by Siza passes through a multi-stage quality validation pipeline. This ensures generated code meets production standards before reaching your codebase.

## Quality Pipeline

### 1. Syntax Validation

The generated code is parsed and validated for:

- Valid JSX/TSX syntax
- Correct import statements
- Proper component structure
- No undefined variables

### 2. Accessibility Checks

Automated WCAG 2.1 compliance scanning:

| Check               | Level | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Alt text            | A     | Images have descriptive alt attributes         |
| ARIA labels         | A     | Interactive elements have accessible names     |
| Color contrast      | AA    | Text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio                |
| Keyboard navigation | A     | All interactions are keyboard-accessible       |
| Semantic HTML       | A     | Correct heading hierarchy and landmark regions |

### 3. Security Scanning

Code is checked for common vulnerabilities:

- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user input
- No inline event handlers with string evaluation
- Safe external link handling (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys

### 4. Quality Scoring

Each generation receives a score from 0-100 based on weighted criteria:

| Criteria       | Weight | Description                       |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Code quality   | 25%    | Clean structure, no code smells   |
| Accessibility  | 25%    | WCAG compliance                   |
| Responsiveness | 20%    | Mobile-first, breakpoint coverage |
| Security       | 30%    | No vulnerabilities                |

**Score thresholds:**

- **90-100**: Excellent - ready for production
- **70-89**: Good - minor improvements suggested
- **50-69**: Fair - review recommended before use
- **Below 50**: Regeneration recommended

## Viewing Quality Reports

### Web App

The generation panel shows quality scores inline. Click the score badge to expand the full report with per-check details.

### MCP / API

Quality data is included in every generation response:

```json
{
  "quality": {
    "score": 94,
    "accessibility": { "score": 92, "issues": [] },
    "security": { "score": 100, "issues": [] },
    "responsiveness": { "score": 90, "issues": ["No xl breakpoint"] }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Quality gates are enabled by default. To adjust thresholds, set the `QUALITY_MIN_SCORE` environment variable:

```bash
QUALITY_MIN_SCORE=80
```

Generations below this score will include a warning in the response.
