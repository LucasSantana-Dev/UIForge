description: How to contribute to Siza
---

Siza is open-source. Contributions welcome across all five repositories.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a feature branch from `main`
4. Make your changes
5. Open a PR against `main`

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/siza.git
cd siza
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each repository has its own `CLAUDE.md` with specific setup instructions and conventions.

## Branching Strategy

We use trunk-based development:

- **main** — production branch, always deployable
- **feat/*** — feature branches
- **fix/*** — bug fix branches
- **chore/*** — maintenance branches

PRs merge to `main` via squash merge.

## Commit Conventions

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) required:

```
feat: Add template pack generation tool
fix: Resolve webhook plan resolution for team tier
refactor: Extract quality scoring into separate module
chore: Update CI workflows to Node 22
docs: Add MCP integration guide
```

## Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- Functions under 50 lines, cyclomatic complexity under 10
- Line width under 100 characters
- No comments unless necessary — code should be self-documenting
- Security-first: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, never expose credentials

## Testing

- Coverage target: 80%+
- Test business logic, not trivial getters/setters
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Use realistic test data

```bash
npm run test        # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e    # E2E tests (siza only)
npm run lint        # Linting
npm run type-check  # TypeScript checking
```
