title: Welcome to Siza
description: The Open Full-Stack AI Workspace
---

Siza generates production-ready UI components, full applications, and design systems with AI.

Named after [Álvaro Siza Vieira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Siza_Vieira), the Portuguese Pritzker Prize-winning architect — Siza transforms how you build interfaces, not just complete code.

## What is Siza?

An open-source AI workspace that connects AI models to your development workflow through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/):

- **Web App** — generate components, manage projects, preview live, export to GitHub
- **MCP Server** — integrate AI generation directly into Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible IDE
- **Design System** — consistent tokens, patterns, and ML-composed templates

## Architecture

Six repositories power the ecosystem:

| Repository         | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **siza**           | Next.js web app + Cloudflare Workers API             |
| **siza-mcp**       | MCP server with 17 AI generation tools               |
| **mcp-gateway**    | Multi-provider AI routing (Gemini, Claude, GPT)      |
| **forge-patterns** | Shared configs, types, and security framework        |
| **siza-gen**       | AI generation core library (extracted from siza-mcp) |
| **branding-mcp**   | Brand identity generation tools                      |
