Siza generates production-ready UI components, full applications, and design systems with AI.

## What is Siza?

Siza is an open-source AI workspace that helps developers generate and manage UI. It combines:

- **Web App** — generate components, manage projects, preview live
- **MCP Server** — integrate AI generation directly into your IDE
- **Design System** — consistent tokens, patterns, and compositions
