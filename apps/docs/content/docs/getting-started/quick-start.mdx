Generate your first AI-powered component in under 5 minutes.

  No account required to try the MCP server — jump to Option B to generate components directly from
  your IDE.

## Option A: Web App

### 1. Sign up

Go to the Siza web app and create an account with email, Google, or GitHub.

### 2. Create a project

Click **New Project** from the dashboard. Give it a name and optional description.

### 3. Generate a component

Navigate to the **Generate** tab. Describe what you want:

```
A pricing card with three tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise),
dark theme, gradient borders, React + Tailwind CSS
```

Select your framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, or HTML) and click **Generate**.

### 4. Preview and iterate

The live preview renders your component instantly. Use the code editor to make adjustments, or click **Refine** and describe changes in natural language:

```
Add a "Most Popular" badge to the Pro tier,
make the CTA buttons more prominent
```

### 5. Export

Click **Export to GitHub** to push directly to a repository, or copy the code from the editor.

## Option B: MCP Server (IDE)

If you prefer working in your IDE, use siza-mcp directly:

```bash
npx @forgespace/ui-mcp
```

This starts the MCP server. Connect it to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf — see the [MCP Integration guide](/docs/guides/mcp-integration) for setup instructions.

Then ask your AI assistant:

```
Generate a dashboard page with a sidebar navigation,
stats cards, and a data table using React and shadcn/ui
```

The MCP server handles component generation with ML-composed templates, quality scoring, and design system consistency.
